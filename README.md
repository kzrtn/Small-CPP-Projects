# Small CPP Projects
My small C++ projects as I poke around, test and learn C++

### Text file stats
A simple CLI program that reads .txt files and outputs the character, word and line count.

How it looks:
```zsh
Enter filename to read: myfile 
This is a six sentence line.
Word count: 6
Character count: 28
Line count: 1
```
Simply compile the program with `clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main` if using clang for compilation, and then `./main` to execute the program.
